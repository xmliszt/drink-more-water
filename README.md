## Overview

**Drink More Water** is a simple web application that helps you keep track of daily water intake and have a fun UI for users to compete against each other. User sets his or her own goal and capacity of the water cup used, and log the water intake for the day. Once achieved the goal, the user will be granted with **1 point** which will be added towards his or her total score. A scoreboard can be viewed to see who has collected the most points.

## Fun to attack!

**Drink More Water** is designed in a way that is totally **NOT SECURE**! In fact, you can login as other users if you want to ;) Try to explore the vulnerability and find ways to login as other user and delete his/her account [don't do that in real life] :p
